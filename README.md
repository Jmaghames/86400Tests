To Run the UI and API tests in the project: 

-Open the terminal window 
-npm run API-test or npm run UI-test

To view the report and screenshots:
 
Go the local repo and open the folder reports>>html-reports

Note: Only the Get endpoints working using HTTPS as I am thinking its not a code issue but they are all passing using HTTP. 

* The chrome window is launching when running the API tests as well because the exports.config is getting triggered from the file wdio.dev.conf.js file ( that setup was done for the UI test framework)
